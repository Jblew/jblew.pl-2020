May the 2021 be even better than the 2020! New year, new virus, new blog! I've refreshed my old jblew.pl blog with posts up to 2009! It's intended to be a **Chronicle**. I am adding here all the content I create for various other initiatives/websites. May it serve as an archive and chronicle for anyone interested in the Curious case of JB Lewandowski. Cheers! ~~~ **What is this steel**?<!--more-->

... This laser-cut through 8mm steel plate is a stabiliser for a 800kg steel+stone fountain I am building now. I've got 8 of these. More details soon...
